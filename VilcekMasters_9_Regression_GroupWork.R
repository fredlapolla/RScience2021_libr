#Regression Group Work

#1. Try making a linear regression to see if there is a linear correlation with Lead as the outcome if predicted by Glucose, Age, LDL and HSQ_1 score (please note this is just an example, in real life your independent variables should have a theoretical reason for inclusion). Try a model with all the variable included and try removing variables and use the AIC to compare them. Make a plot() of your model to assess if it appears to meet the assumptions of a linear model. 




#2. Try out running a basic logistic regression with DiabetesDichotomy as an outcome variable and A1C as the independent variables. Find the odds ratio of the coefficients. Find the confidence intervals of these odd ratios.
